# Weight Lifting Data Pipeline
This repository contains a personal project to get some exposure in data engineering and is my first go at creating any sort of data pipeline. I currently have general data integration / SQL expecerience and am hoping to gain some broader data engineering experience / python experience. Some of the architectural / strategy choices may not be efficient or necessary but are kept in the project for the sake of learning. 


## Overview
This is a first draft to get familiar with git / general best practices 

## Tools

## Pipelines 
Pipeline 1: I am extracting data from an excel document and loading it onto my AWS RDS server. As part of this pipeline I am creating new members via fact file imports to manage the size of my dimension tables. I'll also be implementing a mini file review process as part of the import to ensure data quality. 

## This is a test
