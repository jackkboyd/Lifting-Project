# Weight Lifting Data Pipeline
This repository contains a personal project to get some exposure in data engineering and is my first go at creating any sort of data pipeline. I currently have general data integration / SQL expecerience and am hoping to gain some broader data engineering experience / python experience. Some of the architectural / strategy choices may not be efficient or necessary but are kept in the project for the sake of learning. 


## Overview
This is a first draft to get familiar with git / general best practices
