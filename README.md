# Weight Lifting Data Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains a personal project that is  designed to enhance my skills / gain exposure in data engineering. My goal with this pipeline is to pull all of my weightlifting data, which is tracked with excel on my phone, into a visualization tool to gain insights on my training and track my progress. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Many architectual choices in this project are not optimal / are overkill. These choices are intentional and are here to gain exeprience with more tools + concepts.
